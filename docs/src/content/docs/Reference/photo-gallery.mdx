We use the Photo Gallery component on our homepage to highlight our club's adventures.

The data file for changing these images can be found here:

<FileTree>

  - content
    - pages
    - sections
      - brewer-spotlight.md
      - **image-gallary.md**
  - hooks

</FileTree>

This is a YAML data file with this structure:

```yml
---
enable: true
title: "Horsemen Club Adventures"
description: "Snaps from our Historian and Social Media Maven taken at club events."

# Photos
photos:
  - name: "Happy Hour @ Cowtown Brewing"
    alt-text: "Club members at Cowtown Brewing"
    description: "Club members at Cowtown Brewing"
    image: "/images/horsemen-1.jpg"
    
```

Setting `enable` to false will prevent the gallery from loading any images and the pages using the gallery will not have images to show.

To add images, repeat the YAML structure with new values and ensure that the `image` is stores in the `public/images` folder.

To remove an image, delete its entry in the image-gallary.md file and delete the image from the public/images folder.
