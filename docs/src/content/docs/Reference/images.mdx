Storing images in this folder is essential. If they are not placed here, the build process cannot find them and our users will get a sad `image not found` substitue.

Using the `ImageMod.astro` component is also essential. It lives to resize, optimize, and shrink images for speedy delivery to browsers everywhere. Big images equal slow download speeds and nobody likes slow pages.

Please provide `alt` text descriptions. These are important for screen readers.
