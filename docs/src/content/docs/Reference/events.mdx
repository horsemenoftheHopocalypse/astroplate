<a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r" target="_blank">Horsemen Calendar</a> is easy to update. If you lack permissions to add something directly to the calendar send an invite to <a href="mailto:horsemenofthehops@gmail.com" target="_blank">horsemen of the hops</a>. Once accepted the event it should appear on the calendar for all members.

On the site user's can select their prefered view. Options are `Schedule`, `Week`, and `Month`.
