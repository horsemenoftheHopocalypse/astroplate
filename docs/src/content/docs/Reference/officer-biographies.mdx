import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

All of the data for officers and directors is located here:

<FileTree>
- src
  - config
  - content
    - about
    - **officers**
      - Amanda.md
      - barry.md
    - pages
    - pages
  - hooks

</FileTree>

Title is used for the person's display name, not their actual title. Sorry;

`Position` stores the office/director role name.

`Sort` controls when that bio renders on the index page.

```yml

title: Amanda Berckenhoff Long
position: Secretary
sort: 3

social:
  - name: facebook
    icon: FaFacebook

```

`icon` refers to the Font Awesome icon name for which ever social platform we need.
[FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) hosts the complete universe of icons, but general sticking `fa` and the platform name together will get you what you need.

Below this yaml based front-matter is where the biograph should go. We can use `markdown` in these pages. Basic usage documented here -> [GitHub](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
