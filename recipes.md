#### Rick’s Winnie Church ESB
“This is one of my personal favorites, as I’m a huge fan of traditional English beers in addition to my penchant for German styles. This ESB is a hybrid design I came up with to be somewhere between Fuller’s ESB and Wells Bombardier. A classic caramel maltiness with a nice subtle finish, and just the right balance of hop bitterness to make it a smooth easy-drinking beer. One thing of note with an ESB is that you should pay attention to your water profile – make sure your sulfates are sufficiently high for the style, as this really enhances the flavor profile of the beer and makes it stand out as a traditional example of what an ESB should be.” — Rick Couch
