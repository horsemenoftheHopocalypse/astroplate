      - question: "Tell us about your first batch of homebrew. When did you start?"

      - question: "What's your favorite beer you've ever brewed?"
        answer: "12-gallon batch of tropical stout. Wish it had been 20! 10 gallons went into a rum barrel and the other 2 gallons bottle conditioned. The BA won lots of awards but the 2 gallons that were plain won bigger ones including a BOS at Operation Fermentation and a Bluebonnet stein."
      
      - question: "What about your biggest brew-fail?"
        answer: "EASY, a barrel aged Flanders red. It pressurized in the barrel blew out the bung plug and painted our upstairs bathroom in a fine red mist. Looked like something out of a horror film and my wife still claims to find bits of it lol."
      
      - question: "What's your go-to commercial beer?"
        answer: "Altstadt Brewing’s Kolsch when its hot. Epic Big Bad Baptist when it’s cold. Delirium Tremens anytime."
      
      - question: "What's in your fermenter now?"
        answer: "53 gallons of imperial stout in a Bufflao Trace bourbon barrel. 10 gallons of CBS clone in a maple syrup barrel that once held bourbon. 5 gallons of international dark larger. 5 gallons of schwarzbier. 5 gallons of Belgian blonde. 5 gallons of Trappist single. 6 gallons of orange blossom mead."
      
      - question: "What's your favorite BJCP style to brew? To drink?"

      - question: "Tell us about your brewery. What does your set-up look like?"
        answer: "I mostly use my 5-gallon electric grainfather for small batches or my 20-gallon propane fired morebeer digital brew stand for big batches. I also have 10-gallon keggle propane system and a 5-gallon old school pot and cooler propane system."

    date: "February 3, 2023"
    questions:
      - question: "Tell us about your first batch of homebrew. When did you start?"
        answer: "It was a kit called black dog amber ale - probably wasn't very good but in my memory it was amazing! LOL."
      
      - question: "What's your favorite beer you've ever brewed?"
        answer: "Every few years I make a Flanders Red or Brown and I always love the result and the amount of time that they can cellar as I experience the change over time."
      
      - question: "What about your biggest brew-fail?"
        answer: "Back in the day I threw some herbs into a beer after some inspiration from a book called *The Homebrewer’s Garden.* It became rosemary beer and it was NOT good."
      - question: "What's your go-to commercial beer?"
        answer: "That can be tough because I rarely buy the same thing without a considerable time in between, but Guinness export stout is always good to me."
      
      - question: "What's in your fermenter now?"
        answer: "A British pale ale — clone of Timothy Taylor Landlord"
      
      - question: "What's your favorite BJCP style to brew? To drink?"
        answer: "I love to make and drink a few saisons every summer trying different yeast and hop combinations."
      
      - question: "Tell us about your brewery. What does your set-up look like?"
        answer: "It surprises most people to know that it's pretty basic. I use an Anvil Foundry to mash and will usually boil in that too, but sometimes I'll pull the wort into a kettle for a more aggressive boil on propane."
      
      - question: "Why do you homebrew?"
        answer: "The commercial market just can't offer everything that I want. As much as the commercial offerings have improved over the years (and I still buy plenty of beer every year), my brain buzzes with flavors, aromas and ingredients that either don't have commercial viability or are maybe too 'out there.' Reading about beer and brewing is what really keeps me going in pursuit of something new or something more."

    questions:
      - question: "Tell us about your first batch of homebrew. When did you start?"
        answer: "The first one was a Mr. Beer kit in like 1998 or 1999. Man, it was a bad experience. Fast forward to 2012-ish and I tried a real kit from one of the LHBS. I don't remember exactly what it was."
      - question: "What's your favorite beer you've ever brewed?"
        answer: "One of my most recent brews, was a kit just before I switched to all-grain. A saison with some Bootleg Biology yeast. Turned out GREAT!"
      - question: "What about your biggest brew-fail?"
        answer: "Had to have been about 8 years ago. I had a batch get infected and it was before I found sours like Jester King. I listened to others and wound up dumping it without even trying it."
      - question: "What's your go-to commercial beer?"
        answer: "It'd be a coin toss between whichever Full Grown Man is out and a Weihenstephaner."

      - question: "What's in your fermenter now?"

      - question: "Tell us about your brewery. What does your set-up look like?"

      - question: "Why do you homebrew?"
        answer: "It is relaxing and I enjoy the product. We owned a gelato ice cream shop and still have a food truck and cater that and coffee/espresso drinks. Now that I am all-grain I can play with recipes much like I do with the gelato and adjust recipes to my liking."

    designation: "Homebrewer"
    date: "January 5, 2023"
    questions:
      - question: Tell us about your first batch of homebrew.
        answer: Our first batch was an oatmeal stout all grain. BYO magazine recipe.
      - question: What's your favorite beer you've ever brewed?
        answer: The beer I’ve brewed the most is Ashley Carter’s slow pour pils. I’d love to win a medal for that recipe at BBBO. It’s all pilsner and all hallertau. There’s no room for mistakes with that recipe. Feedback has been all over the place, but it’s such a great beer!
      - question: What's your go-to commercial beer?
        answer: Velvet Hammer by Peticolas. If I see it on the menu somewhere it’s what I’m choosing.
      - question: What's in your fermenter now?
        answer: Fermenters are empty right now. But I have an Oud Bruin and a Flanders Red in secluded carboys that need attention soon.
      - question: What's your favorite BJCP style to brew? To drink?
        answer: 5D - Pilsner - both to brew and to drink
      - question: Tell us about your brewery. What does your set-up look like?
        answer: There’s a dual element Spike Trio that runs off of 220v, there’s a Grainfather, and 2 orange coolers and a Spike kettle from the early days. 
      - question: Why do you homebrew?
        answer: As a recovering microbiologist, and at the encouragement of Silvia tasking me to find a hobby, I became interested in homebrewing. I researched Craiglist for equipment and started attending Dallas Homebrew Collective meetings to learn more about the craft. There’s a harmonious blend of science to it and creativity to it. Also it’s a good team building effort for my marriage. It’s also about the friendships and the camaraderie within the community.
      - question: Any other fun facts
        answer: We travel for beer! My Untapped currently has us at 290 breweries and over 5,000 unique beers. I recently brewed with Sam Calgione (Dogfish Head),  Vinny Cilurzo (Russian River), Neil Fisher (Weld Works), Jason Perkins (Allagash) and Doug Riser (Burial) at Brewer’s Retreat in Rehoboth Beach, DE. It was epic! Last year I brewed with Dick Cantwell (Elysian) and Silvia brewed with Shawn Lawson (Lawson’s Finest Liquids) and JC Tetreault(Trillium) at the Brewer’s Retreat at Russian River.

      - question: What's your favorite beer you've ever brewed?
        answer: The English Strong Ale. The beer changed my trajectory of brewing with its winning record. The Strong Ale got him the silver at BBBO. I've also done some pro-am opportunities with it
      - question: What's your go-to commercial beer?
        answer: Karbach Hopadillo. One that I enjoy and drinks really well. I use that as a calibration beer for potential judges and ask them to write a score sheet against it.

      - question: Tell us about your brewery. What does your set-up look like?
        answer:  use a Grainfather G-40. I have it on a dolly to make it mobile. I brew at the edge of my garage. Nothing super fancy. I eventually want to set up an oven hood and epoxy the garage floor to make a more permanent set up. 
      - question: Why do you homebrew?
        answer: To beat Randy Daily :0)
      - question: Any other fun facts
        answer: I have 2 refrigerators. A commercial beer fridge and a competition beer fridge. When I’m ready to submit beers for competition they are ready to grab and go for mailing or dropping off. I also maintain a spreadsheet on my homebrews that allows me to track the results and scores on competition beers.
