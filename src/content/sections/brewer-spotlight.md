    questions:
      - question: "Tell us about your first batch of homebrew. When did you start?"
        answer: "My fist batch was an extract kit called Caribou Slobber based on Moose Drool from Big Sky Brewing (a brown ale)."
      
      - question: "What's your favorite beer you've ever brewed?"
        answer: "12-gallon batch of tropical stout. Wish it had been 20! 10 gallons went into a rum barrel and the other 2 gallons bottle conditioned. The BA won lots of awards but the 2 gallons that were plain won bigger ones including a BOS at Operation Fermentation and a Bluebonnet stein."
      
      - question: "What about your biggest brew-fail?"
        answer: "EASY, a barrel aged Flanders red. It pressurized in the barrel blew out the bung plug and painted our upstairs bathroom in a fine red mist. Looked like something out of a horror film and my wife still claims to find bits of it lol."
      
      - question: "What's your go-to commercial beer?"
        answer: "Altstadt Brewing’s Kolsch when its hot. Epic Big Bad Baptist when it’s cold. Delirium Tremens anytime."
      
      - question: "What's in your fermenter now?"
        answer: "53 gallons of imperial stout in a Bufflao Trace bourbon barrel. 10 gallons of CBS clone in a maple syrup barrel that once held bourbon. 5 gallons of international dark larger. 5 gallons of schwarzbier. 5 gallons of Belgian blonde. 5 gallons of Trappist single. 6 gallons of orange blossom mead."
      
      - question: "What's your favorite BJCP style to brew? To drink?"

      - question: "Tell us about your brewery. What does your set-up look like?"
        answer: "I mostly use my 5-gallon electric grainfather for small batches or my 20-gallon propane fired morebeer digital brew stand for big batches. I also have 10-gallon keggle propane system and a 5-gallon old school pot and cooler propane system."
      
      - question: "Why do you homebrew?"

    questions:
      - question: "Tell us about your first batch of homebrew. When did you start?"
        answer: "It was a kit called black dog amber ale - probably wasn't very good but in my memory it was amazing! LOL."
      
      - question: "What's your favorite beer you've ever brewed?"
        answer: "Every few years I make a Flanders Red or Brown and I always love the result and the amount of time that they can cellar as I experience the change over time."
      
      - question: "What about your biggest brew-fail?"
        answer: "Back in the day I threw some herbs into a beer after some inspiration from a book called *The Homebrewer’s Garden.* It became rosemary beer and it was NOT good."
      - question: "What's your go-to commercial beer?"
        answer: "That can be tough because I rarely buy the same thing without a considerable time in between, but Guinness export stout is always good to me."
      
      - question: "What's in your fermenter now?"
        answer: "A British pale ale — clone of Timothy Taylor Landlord"
      
      - question: "What's your favorite BJCP style to brew? To drink?"
        answer: "I love to make and drink a few saisons every summer trying different yeast and hop combinations."
      
      - question: "Tell us about your brewery. What does your set-up look like?"
        answer: "It surprises most people to know that it's pretty basic. I use an Anvil Foundry to mash and will usually boil in that too, but sometimes I'll pull the wort into a kettle for a more aggressive boil on propane."
      
      - question: "Why do you homebrew?"
        answer: "The commercial market just can't offer everything that I want. As much as the commercial offerings have improved over the years (and I still buy plenty of beer every year), my brain buzzes with flavors, aromas and ingredients that either don't have commercial viability or are maybe too 'out there.' Reading about beer and brewing is what really keeps me going in pursuit of something new or something more."

    questions:
      - question: "Tell us about your first batch of homebrew. When did you start?"
        answer: "The first one was a Mr. Beer kit in like 1998 or 1999. Man, it was a bad experience. Fast forward to 2012-ish and I tried a real kit from one of the LHBS. I don't remember exactly what it was."
      - question: "What's your favorite beer you've ever brewed?"
        answer: "One of my most recent brews, was a kit just before I switched to all-grain. A saison with some Bootleg Biology yeast. Turned out GREAT!"
      - question: "What about your biggest brew-fail?"
        answer: "Had to have been about 8 years ago. I had a batch get infected and it was before I found sours like Jester King. I listened to others and wound up dumping it without even trying it."
      - question: "What's your go-to commercial beer?"
        answer: "It'd be a coin toss between whichever Full Grown Man is out and a Weihenstephaner."

      - question: "What's in your fermenter now?"
        answer: "Nothing, just kegged a SMaSH and will be brewing a Orange/Chocolate Stout for Christmas 23 on Christmas Eve. That should come in at 11%+."

      - question: "Tell us about your brewery. What does your set-up look like?"

      - question: "Why do you homebrew?"
        answer: "It is relaxing and I enjoy the product. We owned a gelato ice cream shop and still have a food truck and cater that and coffee/espresso drinks. Now that I am all-grain I can play with recipes much like I do with the gelato and adjust recipes to my liking."

    designation: "Homebrewer"
    date: "January 5, 2023"
    questions:
      - question: Tell us about your first batch of homebrew.
        answer: Our first batch was an oatmeal stout all grain. BYO magazine recipe.
      - question: What's your favorite beer you've ever brewed?
        answer: The beer I’ve brewed the most is Ashley Carter’s slow pour pils. I’d love to win a medal for that recipe at BBBO. It’s all pilsner and all hallertau. There’s no room for mistakes with that recipe. Feedback has been all over the place, but it’s such a great beer!
      - question: What's your go-to commercial beer?
        answer: Velvet Hammer by Peticolas. If I see it on the menu somewhere it’s what I’m choosing.
      - question: What's in your fermenter now?
        answer: Fermenters are empty right now. But I have an Oud Bruin and a Flanders Red in secluded carboys that need attention soon.
      - question: What's your favorite BJCP style to brew? To drink?
        answer: 5D - Pilsner - both to brew and to drink
      - question: Tell us about your brewery. What does your set-up look like?
        answer: There’s a dual element Spike Trio that runs off of 220v, there’s a Grainfather, and 2 orange coolers and a Spike kettle from the early days. 
      - question: Why do you homebrew?
        answer: As a recovering microbiologist, and at the encouragement of Silvia tasking me to find a hobby, I became interested in homebrewing. I researched Craiglist for equipment and started attending Dallas Homebrew Collective meetings to learn more about the craft. There’s a harmonious blend of science to it and creativity to it. Also it’s a good team building effort for my marriage. It’s also about the friendships and the camaraderie within the community.
      - question: Any other fun facts
        answer: We travel for beer! My Untapped currently has us at 290 breweries and over 5,000 unique beers. I recently brewed with Sam Calgione (Dogfish Head),  Vinny Cilurzo (Russian River), Neil Fisher (Weld Works), Jason Perkins (Allagash) and Doug Riser (Burial) at Brewer’s Retreat in Rehoboth Beach, DE. It was epic! Last year I brewed with Dick Cantwell (Elysian) and Silvia brewed with Shawn Lawson (Lawson’s Finest Liquids) and JC Tetreault(Trillium) at the Brewer’s Retreat at Russian River.

    questions:
      - question: Tell us about your first batch of homebrew.
        answer: It was an American Brew in a bag. It came out good. Found at Brewer’s Friend.
      - question: What's your favorite beer you've ever brewed?
        answer: The English Strong Ale. The beer changed my trajectory of brewing with its winning record. The Strong Ale got him the silver at BBBO. I've also done some pro-am opportunities with it
      - question: What's your go-to commercial beer?
        answer: Karbach Hopadillo. One that I enjoy and drinks really well. I use that as a calibration beer for potential judges and ask them to write a score sheet against it.
      - question: What's in your fermenter now?
        answer: I have 4 Piwo Grodziskie, a basic Cider that will be split and modified, a Schwartzbier, and a Dopplebock
      - question: What's your favorite BJCP style to brew? To drink?
        answer: German or British. Both have malty and easy to drink styles. For drinking I like Ordinary Bitter and Dark Mild that got Gold at first round NHC
      - question: Tell us about your brewery. What does your set-up look like?
        answer:  use a Grainfather G-40. I have it on a dolly to make it mobile. I brew at the edge of my garage. Nothing super fancy. I eventually want to set up an oven hood and epoxy the garage floor to make a more permanent set up. 
      - question: Why do you homebrew?
        answer: To beat Randy Daily :0)
      - question: Any other fun facts
        answer: I have 2 refrigerators. A commercial beer fridge and a competition beer fridge. When I’m ready to submit beers for competition they are ready to grab and go for mailing or dropping off. I also maintain a spreadsheet on my homebrews that allows me to track the results and scores on competition beers.

    designation: "Homebrewer"
    date: "December 3, 2022"
    questions:
      - question: "Tell us about your first batch of homebrew. When did you start?"
        answer: "I guess it was around 2006 or so, I was at a LAN party (if you know, you know) and one of our crew had brought in some homebrew that he had made. I got to asking Nick about it, and he told me I should check out one of these homebrewing kits if I was interested in learning how to brew my own beer. I bought a simple Brewer’s Best two-bucket kit, a recipe kit for a hefeweizen, and the rest is history."
      
      - question: "What's your favorite beer you've ever brewed?"
        answer: "Probably my Vanilla Bourbon Milk Stout."
      
      - question: "What about your biggest brew-fail?"
        answer: "Without a doubt, my strawberry blonde ale. Trying to be clever (my wife is a ginger), I decided I would make a strawberry blonde ale in her honor. Great idea, right? Unless you use a terrible strawberry extract AND manage to get your wort infected during bottling. Not so much a strawberry blonde ale as a `Robitussin and Band-Aids` ale."
      
      - question: "What's your go-to commercial beer?"
        answer: "Yuengling Black and Tan, whenever I can get my hands on it. On the regular? Wild Acre Billy Jenkins."
      
      - question: "What's in your fermenter now?"
        answer: "Nothing at the moment, as I’m currently renovating my office. Just kegged a Maibock, but nothing in the fermenter right now."
      
      - question: "What's your favorite BJCP style to brew? To drink?"
        answer: "To brew and drink, honestly it’s anything German. Hefeweizen and doppelbock at the top of the list, though."
      
      - question: "Tell us about your brewery. What does your set-up look like?"
        answer: "I’m still working with my original all-grain setup – an Igloo mash tun, 8-gallon Megapot 2.0 brew kettle, standard wort chiller that I run through a cooler of ice. I have two 7-gallon Fermonsters, a chest freezer fermentation chamber, and a new 3-tap keezer I completed about 2 months back. Thinking about moving to either a Foundry or a Grainfather in the not-too-distant future."
      
      - question: "Why do you homebrew?"
        answer: "I love the mad science of it all. Not only am I making delicious beer that I can share with friends and family, but I get to be the “Doc Brown” behind the scenes. I get to develop my own recipes, tinkering all the time, and really customize the beers to my own tastes. While experimenting with recipes is a blast, and brewing even more fun…honestly, it’s also gratifying to get inebriated on beer that I made from water, barley, and hops in my own garage."

    date: "October 3, 2022"
    questions:
      - question: "Tell us about your first batch of homebrew. When did you start?"
        answer: "My first batch was one gallon a version of Joe’s Ancient Orange Mead. Honey, water, yeast, one orange quartered, one cinnamon stick, four cloves. It wasn’t too bad but the cloves overpowered the mead. One day, I would like to repeat the mead but use the better mead processes."
      
      - question: "What's your favorite beer you've ever brewed?"
        answer: "Rum barrel aged tropical stout. It was a style I never tasted so it was a complete chance."
      
      - question: "What about your biggest brew-fail?"
        answer: "I attempted to heat pasteurized bottles of a sweet mead but waited too long before the pasteurization process. Every bottle was a very carbonated fountain upon opening."
      
      - question: "What's your go-to commercial beer?"
        answer: "Weihenstephaner Helles"
      
      - question: "What's in your fermenter now?"
        answer: "art Cherry Buckwheat Session Mead"
      
      - question: "What's your favorite BJCP style to brew? To drink?"
        answer: "Anything German, British or mead"
      
      - question: "Tell us about your brewery. What does your set-up look like?"
        answer: "Anvil Foundry, fermentation buckets and a freezer with temperature control as a fermentation chamber"
      
      - question: "Why do you homebrew?"
        answer: "It gives me a creative outlet which is fun to share with others."

    date: "April 7, 2023"
    questions:
      - question: "Tell us about your first batch of homebrew. When did you start?"
        answer: "A pale ale kit brewed on my first, and last, Mr. Beer little brown keg. The beer was very poor. It tasted a little tart, along with some apples and sadness. But I was hooked! Next weekend I went to Dr. Jeckyll’s Beer Lab and bought a basic brewing kit along with John Palmer’s `How To Brew`, and off I went!"
      
      - question: "What's your favorite beer you've ever brewed?"
        answer: "Two years ago I brewed an Imperial Stout with chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon and three different peppers. It took almost a year from grain to glass, so I nursed it slowly to the delicious final drop."
      
      - question: "What about your biggest brew-fail?"
        answer: "I cleaned my keezer one day, then loaded back in the four kegs of beer and went off about my business. Of course, I forgot to add my temperature controller’s thermometer back into the keezer. So the next time I checked on them there were four frozen beer pops!"
      
      - question: "What's your go-to commercial beer?"
        answer: "As someone who loves clear beer I almost feel bad about this selection, but I love Lone Pint’s Yellow Rose IPA. A simple SMaSH beer with loads of Mosaic. Yes, please!"
      
      - question: "What's in your fermenter now?"
        answer: "Nothing. Currently dealing with two failed chest freezers in my little brewery, so working on making some changes and maybe a little reconfigure. Hopefully back at it again very soon."
      
      - question: "What's your favorite BJCP style to brew? To drink?"
        answer: "Probably 7A – Vienna Lager to brew. Oktoberfest to drink. Fest or Märzen. I love that time of year!"
      
      - question: "Tell us about your brewery. What does your set-up look like?"
        answer: "Three chest freezers (when they work), a keezer, lager and fermentation chambers. I brew on a second-generation Grainfather."

      - question: "Why do you homebrew?"
        answer: "I really enjoy the process. From the time spent creating a recipe, the wonderful smells on brewday, getting to share some pints with others. Homebrewing is my happy place."

  - name: "Matt Wilson"
    avatar: "/images/matt-wilson.jpg"
    designation: "Homebrewer"
    date: "May 5, 2023"
    questions:
      - question: "Tell us about your first batch of homebrew. When did you start?"
        answer: "I started brewing in 1985 while I lived in Washington state where I was born and raised. My first batch was started on our kitchen cooktop in a ceramic canning kettle. I mixed boiling tap water with a can of malt and hop extract, purchased “off-the-shelf” at Albertson’s. How times were different. The mixture was transferred into a glass carboy of cold water and given a dose of Red Star yeast for two weeks until being siphoned to bottles holding a scant teaspoon of priming sugar. I’ll always remember the sight of the CO2 vapor as it curled up and out from the top of the bottle as a pop sounded with the removal of the cap. My mentors, a handful of men from the depression era, brewers of the ceramic crock and cheesecloth cover, cheered at the sight. According to them, this was the most important signal of a fine beer."
      
      - question: "What's your favorite beer you've ever brewed?"
        answer: "That’s a hard question. Maybe my last brew. I made the Wanderlust Saison (from Rabbit Hole Brewing) as part of the April club competition. Ingredients such as Grains of Paradise, bitter orange peel and Belgian yeast were unfamiliar to me. The experience really opened my eyes to the greater world of beers."
      
      - question: "What about your biggest brew-fail?"
        answer: "For several years, I brewed on a homemade three kettle, gravity flow, propane system consisting of full-size beer kegs modified with cut-off tops, and stainless handles welded near the tops and ball valves fashioned near the bottoms. After many months of use, out of the blue, two batches of beer spoiled from bacterial infections. I was flabbergasted because my sanitation practices are a top priority. After a lot of head scratching, I decided to disassemble the boiling kettle’s ball valve and fittings. Here I found the source of the problem where the ball valve connected to a compression fitting securing a copper pipe used to hold the transfer hose.
"
      
      - question: "What's your go-to commercial beer?"
        answer: "Lately, I’ve gravitated to New Belgium Imperial IPA."
      
      - question: "What's in your fermenter now?"
        answer: "A clone of Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale"
      
      - question: "What's your favorite BJCP style to brew? To drink?"
        answer: "My favorite style to brew and drink is probably style 21 IPA, which has so much room for interesting variations. For example, I recently brewed my first Hazy IPA, and it was so fun planning three dry hop additions using sous vide magnets, suspending 33 ounces of hops under the top of the fermenter."
      
      - question: "Tell us about your brewery. What does your set-up look like?"
        answer: "I stopped homebrewing in 1999 when our family moved from Washington to Fort Worth with my job transfer, but with my recent retirement I came back to brewing. In preparation, I framed in and closed off a storage area in our garage and built a little brewery inside to suit my needs. It has a plumbed sink with hot and cold water, 110 and 220-volt power outlets, a 35-gallon RO water system, an exhaust fan housed with a make-up air return and central air and heat. I brew with a 220-volt, 65-liter Brewzilla 3 in 1 system. I also have a 35-liter Brewzilla used mostly for sparge water. I ferment in Kegland Kegmenters of various sizes and Corny kegs, both 5 and 2.5 gallons in size. I have three chest freezers (7 cubic ft.). The set-up provides the option to ferment under pressure and transfer under pressure along the process."
      
      - question: "Why do you homebrew?"
        answer: "I brew for the fun and enjoyment of brewing. I like the challenges inherent in brewing. It’s difficult to make good beer, but when a batch turns out great, it feels so rewarding after all the effort expended in the process. I also really enjoy the social aspects of being a member in the Horsemen of the Hopocalypse. Our gatherings are such a great opportunity to talk about brewing while we share other aspects of our lives together."

    date: "June 2, 2023"
    questions:
      - question: "Tell us about your first batch of homebrew. When did you start?"
        answer: "The first thing I did was a five-gallon batch of mead that I split into single gallons in secondary to play with fun flavors. My husband had been brewing for a few years at this point, and was on his second batch of mead, so he helped me out a lot.
        
        The flavors I made were plum, 'pecan pie', apple and strawberry with rose petals. The pecan pie was probably the best one."
      
      - question: "What's your favorite beer you've ever brewed?"
        answer: " It’s a tie.

- **Big O Tatties**, a sweet potato casserole inspired Wee Heavy. I’d wanted to make a beer based on my aunt’s casserole recipe (before you ask, she makes hers with pecans, not marshmallows) and with the help of another homebrew Facebook group I’m in, I decided on a Scotch Ale for the base. It turned out to be accidentally smoked because my oven doesn’t work, so to caramelize the sweet potatoes I used our smoker. This was a neat addition for about two months, and then it went weird. 

- **Plum Out of Control**, a plum pale ale, so named because when I added the plums to the secondary I roused the yeasties a bit too much and at around 4 a.m. the airlock came flying off and I was smacked in the face with plum from across my bedroom! This one was fun because in addition to the Cascade hops that the recipe (from The Homebrewers’ Recipe Guide) called for, I also added rose petals and heather tips. I also added champagne yeast, because I had some on hand, when the pale ale yeast seemed to have stalled in the primary. This all led to a light and bubbly pink beer that was perfect for floating the river."
      
      - question: "What about your biggest brew-fail?"
        answer: "Thankfully the last one didn't become a fail, it was close though! I have to say my biggest fail was my attempt at watermelon mead. If you've tried to brew anything with watermelon then you know what I'm about to say. It started out smelling so good, until one day, it did not. Apparently watermelon rots faster than the yeasties can make alcohol to preserve it, and it went from heavenly to sickening so fast. I had looked at so many homebrew forums and YouTube videos before trying this, to see how much fruit I'd probably need per gallon, and not a single one warned me."
      
      - question: "What's your go-to commercial beer?"
        answer: "Oh, that's tough. I could list my favorite styles for you but to keep it simple let's say I'm at Bull & Bush, I'm definitely going to start with a Smithwicks."
      
      - question: "What's in your fermenter now?"
        answer: "Sadly, nothing. I haven't really had the time to brew in the last year or so. But I have a brew in mind for my next: I've been foraging dewberries and mulberries that grow in our yard for a couple years and I think with this year's crop I should have enough in my freezer to finally do it. I'm leaning towards a wheat ale using the berries. We also have a yucca plant that's blooming right now, if I can dry out the petals I might use that for the bittering. AND I want to set aside at least a gallon of it to do a wild fermentation (or use some of the juniper berries from our trees). Basically I want a beer that tastes like our yard during spring."
      
      - question: "What's your favorite BJCP style to brew? To drink?"
        answer: "To brew? I'm not sure if I've made something that strictly adheres to their guidelines, lol. To drink? Probably an Irish Red. If a brewery has one on tap I'm getting it.
"
      
      - question: "Tell us about your brewery. What does your set-up look like?"
        answer: " It looks a lot like a storage room, a kitchen and/or my back porch, haha. All of our equipment and other goodies are in our storage room (which I can proudly say you can easily get in and out of now). If I'm doing a mead, wine, cider or an extract brew I'm in my kitchen, and if it's all-grain then we're set up out on the porch with my Clawhammer BIAB system. Sadly, it's only been used once so far because after I got it mine and my husband's work schedules sort of stopped cooperating and I'm still a bit intimidated by it to attempt a solo brew day."
      
      - question: "Why do you homebrew?"
        answer: "As I mentioned many times, playing with flavors is my favorite. I look through cookbooks and how ingredients work together in a dish and think, \"I wonder if that would work in a beer.\"
        
        I am a creative by nature. I love to make things and to share them. Brewing is another way to do that."

    questions:
      - question: "Tell us about your first batch of homebrew. When did you start?"
        answer: "My first batch was sometime in the ‘90s. I did extract brewing for a few years but I am certain it was pretty miserable by today's standards. I had no community or internet to refine my knowledge and processes. I joined the Horsemen shortly after retiring a year ago and started asking questions about what I should get for equipment. I built my kegerator first using a 7CF chest freezer, and put in two taps. Now it's time for beer. Still treading lightly on what to buy, I went to Jarrett's big brew day, brought home five gallons of Old Ale and did the fermentation and kegging. Meanwhile, I met the Big Cypress crew at Stacy Myers' crawfish boil and Stacy stepped up to mentor for me. We brewed a Cali Common at his place and I brought home five gallons to finish. A month or so later, having purchased a surplus Anvil Foundry all-in-one kit from John Skelton, I endeavored to brew my first solo batch. A Ful Croi Irish Red. I was painstakingly careful...wrote out every step. It came out great. I entered a later batch of this same recipe in 2023 Bluebonnet (my first competition) and it scored a combined 41 and made mini-BOS."
      
      - question: "What's your favorite beer you've ever brewed?"
        answer: "This past winter, I decided to try lagering. My medieval way of getting lower fermentation temp is an Igloo cooler water bath and frozen water bottles to modulate (thanks, Chris Bart for the suggestion). Six weeks or so later, I learned about diacetyl when my Munich Helles had a distinct buttery taste. (It cleared up in the keg.) At this time, I was a week into fermenting a Helles Export so I raised the temperature the second week to clear up the diacetyl.  It worked and every time I poured one through the life of that keg I would think to myself: “that's a damn fine pour!” To this day, my favorite."
      
      - question: "What about your biggest brew-fail?"
        answer: "Two, actually.

- The day I started late in the afternoon and rushed myself and forgot to insert the mash tun before adding grain. I brainstormed ways to save it but knew I'd always question the outcome so I bailed and dumped it. 

- I brewed an Oktoberfest and was preparing to rack to the fermenter. I hoisted the Anvil onto something that was inadequate for the purpose (although I'd done this same way several times before). I turned to get a piece of hose and the whole thing tipped. Five gallons of Oktoberfest wort down the driveway. I didn't initially want to share with club members but have since found everyone has a similar \"oh s***!\" story."
      
      - question: "What's your go-to commercial beer?"
        answer: "If it's a long, hot day at the pool or lake...a light Anheuser-Busch product often makes it to my cooler. My favorite all time commercial beer is Red Hook ESB. Can't find it here these days but I have a clone in my kegerator as we speak."
      
      - question: "What's in your fermenter now?"
        answer: "I have three taps on my kegerator that have Red Hook ESB, Belgian pale ale, and a Scottish ale. Nothing fermenting...no room at the inn."
      
      - question: "What's your favorite BJCP style to brew? To drink?"
        answer: "I like malty-front with a bitter finish so German lagers, ESBs, and Cali Commons."
      
      - question: "Tell us about your brewery. What does your set-up look like?"
        answer: "A 10-gallon Anvil Foundry with two Fermonsters, igloo water bath, and three-tap kegerator. Pretty pedestrian."
      
      - question: "Why do you homebrew?"
        answer: "When I was coming up on retirement, a common question is: what are you gonna do with all that time? I wasn't sure either. It's such a paradigm shift from having worked 40 years in engineering. I enjoyed my extract brewing back in the ‘90s but wanted to step up quality and include all-grain. My first call was to Brewhound when I asked Chris about classes. He directed me to the Horsemen and I attended my first gathering at Cowtown the next night. I attribute the camaraderie and knowledge Horsemen offers as the reason I've stuck with it."

    questions:
      - question: "Tell us about your first batch of homebrew. When did you start?"
        answer: "I started with a basic Mr. Beer kit with an old can of hopped LME. I’d learned to brew with my dad, who had started a bit before me on the same kit. When it was my turn, I kicked things off wit a hefeweizen. Not award-winning, but not the worst beer you’ve ever had!"
      
      - question: "What's your favorite beer you've ever brewed?"
        answer: "Probably a tie between a smoked pecan porter I’ve made several years in a row, and my carrot and dried leaves ale. Both use smoke, which I love in beer, and homegrown ingredients. The pecans are from two big trees in the yard, and the leaves are from the same pecan trees. The porter is always robust and great for a cold winter’s night, and the ale is surprisingly balanced and refreshing!"
      
      - question: "What about your biggest brew-fail?"
        answer: "I’ve got two horror stories. 
        - One was after I had a perfect brew day — everything went just the way I wanted to. Hit my OG, mash was perfect, everything was going smoothly. First time I was really happy with the way a brew day had gone. Then, after I’d transferred six gallons to a carboy, I slipped and shattered the whole thing in my garage, sending wort spilling everywhere. 
        - The other horror story comes from a terrible brew day where nothing went right. Stuck mash, low volume, missed a hop addition, yeast didn’t get started right, a total Murphy’s Law of a brew. I ended up calling it SNAFU Brown Ale."
      
      - question: "What's your go-to commercial beer?"
        answer: "I’ve been digging HopFusion’s Feisty Blonde and Community’s Citra Slice this time of year. Gotta love Duchesse de Bourgogne for a special occasion, though."
      
      - question: "What's in your fermenter now?"
        answer: "Got a Märzen that was brewed back in March and should be coming out of the lagering chamber in a few weeks. I’ve also got a batch of mead from the club’s mead day that’s aging, too."
      
      - question: "What's your favorite BJCP style to brew? To drink?"
        answer: "I love drinking and brewing German lagers, but it’s tough with my temp control setup. Favorite to drink is a good (which is hard to find) Kellerbier or Rauchbier."
      
      - question: "Tell us about your brewery. What does your set-up look like?"
        answer: "I brew on a 10-gallon Blichmann Boilermaker with a SS mash tun. I ferment most things in an SS Chronical. Everything ends up in my four-keg keezer."
      
      - question: "Why do you homebrew?"
        answer: "I love working to make fresh beers that I can’t get anywhere else. I like experimenting with flavors to create balanced beers with unique, local ingredients. I want the beer I make to taste like it’s made here. I want to find ways to use quality ingredients and processes, combined with some elements of terroir to make a really great pint. (Two major book recs on this philosophy: [The Homebrewers’ Almanac](https://a.co/d/gBYTjvH) and [The Shape of Brewing](https://a.co/d/gBYTjvH), both available at BrewHound.) A big part of why I brew is also getting to make beer with my dad, a former commercial brewer. We work as a team on most recipes, and get to spend time together making the best beer possible."

    questions:
      - question: "Tell us about your first batch of homebrew. When did you start?"
        answer: "I don't exactly remember it has been a long time, but when I started, all-grain wasn't a thing for homebrewers.  I brewed my first batch in 2002. A neighbor taught me how to brew with extract using specialty grains. It was basically a turkey fryer set-up and a glass carboy as a fermenter that I kept in a cool closet.  And the saying is absolutely true: 'Give a man a beer and he will waste a day.  Teach a man to brew and he will waste a lifetime'"
      
      - question: "What's your favorite beer you've ever brewed?"
        answer: "Eisbock! I brewed a recipe that has been handed down several times and the stars literally lined up the first time I brewed it. It took first at Bluebonnet and Nationals that year and Rabbit Hole selected it to brew (and invited me to help brew it) and called it [School of Bock](https://homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/the-king-of-eisbocks/). The cool thing about this recipe (which you can find on the AHA website) is there is no freezing involved."
      
      - question: "What about your biggest brew-fail?"
        answer: "There was one winter our temps were expected to drop below freezing for a time and someone suggested it would be a good time to freeze a keg. I happened to have a dopplebock in a keg and set it out on the patio to make a traditional eisbock. I weighed it before it froze and after I racked off the non-frozen liquid to another keg. 20% remained in the original keg as ice. I set that keg aside for a year to let it lager and when I tasted it, it had picked up an infection and it went sour and I had to dump it."
      
      - question: "What's your go-to commercial beer?"
        answer: "I am a huge fan of Cowtown's Vienna. I can't tell you how much money I've dropped on that particular beer. Now I wished I had invested when they started. =) When I have commercial beer at the house, the styles are all over the place. I like a variety."
      
      - question: "What's in your fermenter now?"
        answer: "Unfortunately, nothing. I started my own business a little over 5-years ago and it takes up a lot of time and has severely reduced my ability to brew. When I do brew, I will try to knock out two beers over a weekend. I have managed to cobble seven entries together for Bluebonnet this year."
      
      - question: "What's your favorite BJCP style to brew? To drink?"
        answer: "Oktoberfest for both. Every year as breweries produce their seasonal Oktoberfests I end up buying probably 8-10 different six-packs of Oktoberfest to see who's best. I usually hover toward Ayinger and Hacker-Pschorr. I am a big fan of German lagers and like to brew Helles, Vienna, Oktoberfest, and Doppelbocks."
      
      - question: "Tell us about your brewery. What does your set-up look like?"
        answer: "t's a two-tier HERMS set-up. I bought the burner stand at Academy a long time ago. I welded in a banjo burner on the boil kettle side to get up to temp faster. If I have time to pre-plan my brew day I will get all the water ready the night before and will use a heat stick in the hot liquor tank overnight to get it up to about 160F which saves some time in the morning. I have two different mash-tuns depending on what I am brewing, a 10-gallon for lower OG beers and a 15-gallon for big beers or if I am splitting a batch with a friend. I have been through a couple different mashtuns and am sold on Blichmann."
      
      - question: "Why do you homebrew?"
        answer: "I really like beer and the brewing process. I like having creative control over the process and trying to duplicate a good beer over again, which isn't always easy to do."
