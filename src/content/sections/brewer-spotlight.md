      - question: "What about your biggest brew-fail?"
        answer: "EASY, a barrel aged Flanders red. It pressurized in the barrel blew out the bung plug and painted our upstairs bathroom in a fine red mist. Looked like something out of a horror film and my wife still claims to find bits of it lol."
      
      - question: "What's your go-to commercial beer?"
        answer: "Altstadt Brewing’s Kolsch when its hot. Epic Big Bad Baptist when it’s cold. Delirium Tremens anytime."
      
      - question: "What's in your fermenter now?"

      - question: "Tell us about your brewery. What does your set-up look like?"
        answer: "I mostly use my 5-gallon electric grainfather for small batches or my 20-gallon propane fired morebeer digital brew stand for big batches. I also have 10-gallon keggle propane system and a 5-gallon old school pot and cooler propane system."

    date: "February 3, 2023"
    questions:
      - question: "Tell us about your first batch of homebrew. When did you start?"
        answer: "It was a kit called black dog amber ale - probably wasn't very good but in my memory it was amazing! LOL."
      
      - question: "What's your favorite beer you've ever brewed?"
        answer: "Every few years I make a Flanders Red or Brown and I always love the result and the amount of time that they can cellar as I experience the change over time."
      
      - question: "What about your biggest brew-fail?"
        answer: "Back in the day I threw some herbs into a beer after some inspiration from a book called *The Homebrewer’s Garden.* It became rosemary beer and it was NOT good."
      - question: "What's your go-to commercial beer?"
        answer: "That can be tough because I rarely buy the same thing without a considerable time in between, but Guinness export stout is always good to me."
      
      - question: "What's in your fermenter now?"
        answer: "A British pale ale — clone of Timothy Taylor Landlord"
      
      - question: "What's your favorite BJCP style to brew? To drink?"
        answer: "I love to make and drink a few saisons every summer trying different yeast and hop combinations."
      
      - question: "Tell us about your brewery. What does your set-up look like?"
        answer: "It surprises most people to know that it's pretty basic. I use an Anvil Foundry to mash and will usually boil in that too, but sometimes I'll pull the wort into a kettle for a more aggressive boil on propane."
      
      - question: "Why do you homebrew?"
        answer: "The commercial market just can't offer everything that I want. As much as the commercial offerings have improved over the years (and I still buy plenty of beer every year), my brain buzzes with flavors, aromas and ingredients that either don't have commercial viability or are maybe too 'out there.' Reading about beer and brewing is what really keeps me going in pursuit of something new or something more."

    questions:
      - question: "Tell us about your first batch of homebrew. When did you start?"
        answer: "The first one was a Mr. Beer kit in like 1998 or 1999. Man, it was a bad experience. Fast forward to 2012-ish and I tried a real kit from one of the LHBS. I don't remember exactly what it was."
      - question: "What's your favorite beer you've ever brewed?"
        answer: "One of my most recent brews, was a kit just before I switched to all-grain. A saison with some Bootleg Biology yeast. Turned out GREAT!"
      - question: "What about your biggest brew-fail?"
        answer: "Had to have been about 8 years ago. I had a batch get infected and it was before I found sours like Jester King. I listened to others and wound up dumping it without even trying it."
      - question: "What's your go-to commercial beer?"
        answer: "It'd be a coin toss between whichever Full Grown Man is out and a Weihenstephaner."

      - question: "What's in your fermenter now?"
        answer: "Nothing, just kegged a SMaSH and will be brewing a Orange/Chocolate Stout for Christmas 23 on Christmas Eve. That should come in at 11%+."

      - question: "Tell us about your brewery. What does your set-up look like?"

      - question: "Why do you homebrew?"
        answer: "It is relaxing and I enjoy the product. We owned a gelato ice cream shop and still have a food truck and cater that and coffee/espresso drinks. Now that I am all-grain I can play with recipes much like I do with the gelato and adjust recipes to my liking."

  - name: "Barry Forrest"

    designation: "Homebrewer"
    date: "January 5, 2023"
    questions:
      - question: Tell us about your first batch of homebrew.
        answer: Our first batch was an oatmeal stout all grain. BYO magazine recipe.
      - question: What's your favorite beer you've ever brewed?
        answer: The beer I’ve brewed the most is Ashley Carter’s slow pour pils. I’d love to win a medal for that recipe at BBBO. It’s all pilsner and all hallertau. There’s no room for mistakes with that recipe. Feedback has been all over the place, but it’s such a great beer!
      - question: What's your go-to commercial beer?
        answer: Velvet Hammer by Peticolas. If I see it on the menu somewhere it’s what I’m choosing.
      - question: What's in your fermenter now?
        answer: Fermenters are empty right now. But I have an Oud Bruin and a Flanders Red in secluded carboys that need attention soon.
      - question: What's your favorite BJCP style to brew? To drink?
        answer: 5D - Pilsner - both to brew and to drink
      - question: Tell us about your brewery. What does your set-up look like?
        answer: There’s a dual element Spike Trio that runs off of 220v, there’s a Grainfather, and 2 orange coolers and a Spike kettle from the early days. 
      - question: Why do you homebrew?
        answer: As a recovering microbiologist, and at the encouragement of Silvia tasking me to find a hobby, I became interested in homebrewing. I researched Craiglist for equipment and started attending Dallas Homebrew Collective meetings to learn more about the craft. There’s a harmonious blend of science to it and creativity to it. Also it’s a good team building effort for my marriage. It’s also about the friendships and the camaraderie within the community.
      - question: Any other fun facts
        answer: We travel for beer! My Untapped currently has us at 290 breweries and over 5,000 unique beers. I recently brewed with Sam Calgione (Dogfish Head),  Vinny Cilurzo (Russian River), Neil Fisher (Weld Works), Jason Perkins (Allagash) and Doug Riser (Burial) at Brewer’s Retreat in Rehoboth Beach, DE. It was epic! Last year I brewed with Dick Cantwell (Elysian) and Silvia brewed with Shawn Lawson (Lawson’s Finest Liquids) and JC Tetreault(Trillium) at the Brewer’s Retreat at Russian River.

      - question: Tell us about your first batch of homebrew.
        answer: It was an American Brew in a bag. It came out good. Found at Brewer’s Friend.
      - question: What's your favorite beer you've ever brewed?
        answer: The English Strong Ale. The beer changed my trajectory of brewing with its winning record. The Strong Ale got him the silver at BBBO. I've also done some pro-am opportunities with it
      - question: What's your go-to commercial beer?
        answer: Karbach Hopadillo. One that I enjoy and drinks really well. I use that as a calibration beer for potential judges and ask them to write a score sheet against it.
      - question: What's in your fermenter now?
        answer: I have 4 Piwo Grodziskie, a basic Cider that will be split and modified, a Schwartzbier, and a Dopplebock
      - question: What's your favorite BJCP style to brew? To drink?
        answer: German or British. Both have malty and easy to drink styles. For drinking I like Ordinary Bitter and Dark Mild that got Gold at first round NHC
      - question: Tell us about your brewery. What does your set-up look like?
        answer:  use a Grainfather G-40. I have it on a dolly to make it mobile. I brew at the edge of my garage. Nothing super fancy. I eventually want to set up an oven hood and epoxy the garage floor to make a more permanent set up. 
      - question: Why do you homebrew?
        answer: To beat Randy Daily :0)
      - question: Any other fun facts
        answer: I have 2 refrigerators. A commercial beer fridge and a competition beer fridge. When I’m ready to submit beers for competition they are ready to grab and go for mailing or dropping off. I also maintain a spreadsheet on my homebrews that allows me to track the results and scores on competition beers.

    designation: "Homebrewer"
    date: "December 3, 2022"
    questions:
      - question: "Tell us about your first batch of homebrew. When did you start?"
        answer: "I guess it was around 2006 or so, I was at a LAN party (if you know, you know) and one of our crew had brought in some homebrew that he had made. I got to asking Nick about it, and he told me I should check out one of these homebrewing kits if I was interested in learning how to brew my own beer. I bought a simple Brewer’s Best two-bucket kit, a recipe kit for a hefeweizen, and the rest is history."
      
      - question: "What's your favorite beer you've ever brewed?"
        answer: "Probably my Vanilla Bourbon Milk Stout."
      
      - question: "What about your biggest brew-fail?"
        answer: "Without a doubt, my strawberry blonde ale. Trying to be clever (my wife is a ginger), I decided I would make a strawberry blonde ale in her honor. Great idea, right? Unless you use a terrible strawberry extract AND manage to get your wort infected during bottling. Not so much a strawberry blonde ale as a `Robitussin and Band-Aids` ale."
      
      - question: "What's your go-to commercial beer?"
        answer: "Yuengling Black and Tan, whenever I can get my hands on it. On the regular? Wild Acre Billy Jenkins."
      
      - question: "What's in your fermenter now?"
        answer: "Nothing at the moment, as I’m currently renovating my office. Just kegged a Maibock, but nothing in the fermenter right now."
      
      - question: "What's your favorite BJCP style to brew? To drink?"
        answer: "To brew and drink, honestly it’s anything German. Hefeweizen and doppelbock at the top of the list, though."
      
      - question: "Tell us about your brewery. What does your set-up look like?"
        answer: "I’m still working with my original all-grain setup – an Igloo mash tun, 8-gallon Megapot 2.0 brew kettle, standard wort chiller that I run through a cooler of ice. I have two 7-gallon Fermonsters, a chest freezer fermentation chamber, and a new 3-tap keezer I completed about 2 months back. Thinking about moving to either a Foundry or a Grainfather in the not-too-distant future."
      
      - question: "Why do you homebrew?"
        answer: "I love the mad science of it all. Not only am I making delicious beer that I can share with friends and family, but I get to be the “Doc Brown” behind the scenes. I get to develop my own recipes, tinkering all the time, and really customize the beers to my own tastes. While experimenting with recipes is a blast, and brewing even more fun…honestly, it’s also gratifying to get inebriated on beer that I made from water, barley, and hops in my own garage."

    designation: "Homebrewer"
    date: "October 3, 2022"
    questions:
      - question: "Tell us about your first batch of homebrew. When did you start?"
        answer: "My first batch was one gallon a version of Joe’s Ancient Orange Mead. Honey, water, yeast, one orange quartered, one cinnamon stick, four cloves. It wasn’t too bad but the cloves overpowered the mead. One day, I would like to repeat the mead but use the better mead processes."
      
      - question: "What's your favorite beer you've ever brewed?"
        answer: "Rum barrel aged tropical stout. It was a style I never tasted so it was a complete chance."
      
      - question: "What about your biggest brew-fail?"
        answer: "I attempted to heat pasteurized bottles of a sweet mead but waited too long before the pasteurization process. Every bottle was a very carbonated fountain upon opening."
      
      - question: "What's your go-to commercial beer?"
        answer: "Weihenstephaner Helles"
      
      - question: "What's in your fermenter now?"
        answer: "art Cherry Buckwheat Session Mead"

        answer: "Anything German, British or mead"
      
      - question: "Tell us about your brewery. What does your set-up look like?"
        answer: "Anvil Foundry, fermentation buckets and a freezer with temperature control as a fermentation chamber"
      
      - question: "Why do you homebrew?"
        answer: "It gives me a creative outlet which is fun to share with others."

    date: "April 7, 2023"
    questions:
      - question: "Tell us about your first batch of homebrew. When did you start?"
        answer: "A pale ale kit brewed on my first, and last, Mr. Beer little brown keg. The beer was very poor. It tasted a little tart, along with some apples and sadness. But I was hooked! Next weekend I went to Dr. Jeckyll’s Beer Lab and bought a basic brewing kit along with John Palmer’s `How To Brew`, and off I went!"
      
      - question: "What's your favorite beer you've ever brewed?"
        answer: "Two years ago I brewed an Imperial Stout with chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon and three different peppers. It took almost a year from grain to glass, so I nursed it slowly to the delicious final drop."
      
      - question: "What about your biggest brew-fail?"
        answer: "I cleaned my keezer one day, then loaded back in the four kegs of beer and went off about my business. Of course, I forgot to add my temperature controller’s thermometer back into the keezer. So the next time I checked on them there were four frozen beer pops!"
      
      - question: "What's your go-to commercial beer?"
        answer: "As someone who loves clear beer I almost feel bad about this selection, but I love Lone Pint’s Yellow Rose IPA. A simple SMaSH beer with loads of Mosaic. Yes, please!"
      
      - question: "What's in your fermenter now?"
        answer: "Nothing. Currently dealing with two failed chest freezers in my little brewery, so working on making some changes and maybe a little reconfigure. Hopefully back at it again very soon."
      
      - question: "What's your favorite BJCP style to brew? To drink?"
        answer: "Probably 7A – Vienna Lager to brew. Oktoberfest to drink. Fest or Märzen. I love that time of year!"
      
      - question: "Tell us about your brewery. What does your set-up look like?"
        answer: "Three chest freezers (when they work), a keezer, lager and fermentation chambers. I brew on a second-generation Grainfather."

      - question: "Why do you homebrew?"
        answer: "I really enjoy the process. From the time spent creating a recipe, the wonderful smells on brewday, getting to share some pints with others. Homebrewing is my happy place."

    questions:
      - question: "Tell us about your first batch of homebrew. When did you start?"
        answer: "Wheat beer extract kit from the local homebrew store. Matt said I nailed the color and carbonation, and that was about it."
      
      - question: "What's your favorite beer you've ever brewed?"
        answer: "I have many favorites including German pils, rauchbier, roggenbier, altbier, IPA, oatmeal stouts, wit, fruit beer, etc. Favorite will depend on time of year."
      
      - question: "What about your biggest brew-fail?"
        answer: "Currently have a keg on tap with acetaldehyde. it happens. Not the first time and won't be the last. Stuck mashes suck too!"
      
      - question: "What's your go-to commercial beer?"
        answer: "Once again, will be determined by time of year. Currently enjoying some of the Oktoberfest that recently hit the shelves"

    designation: "Homebrewer"
    date: "March 3, 2023"
    questions:
      - question: "Tell us about your first batch of homebrew. When did you start?"
        answer: "I don't exactly remember it has been a long time, but when I started, all-grain wasn't a thing for homebrewers.  I brewed my first batch in 2002. A neighbor taught me how to brew with extract using specialty grains. It was basically a turkey fryer set-up and a glass carboy as a fermenter that I kept in a cool closet.  And the saying is absolutely true: 'Give a man a beer and he will waste a day.  Teach a man to brew and he will waste a lifetime'"
      
      - question: "What's your favorite beer you've ever brewed?"
        answer: "Eisbock! I brewed a recipe that has been handed down several times and the stars literally lined up the first time I brewed it. It took first at Bluebonnet and Nationals that year and Rabbit Hole selected it to brew (and invited me to help brew it) and called it [School of Bock](https://homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/the-king-of-eisbocks/). The cool thing about this recipe (which you can find on the AHA website) is there is no freezing involved."
      
      - question: "What about your biggest brew-fail?"
        answer: "There was one winter our temps were expected to drop below freezing for a time and someone suggested it would be a good time to freeze a keg. I happened to have a dopplebock in a keg and set it out on the patio to make a traditional eisbock. I weighed it before it froze and after I racked off the non-frozen liquid to another keg. 20% remained in the original keg as ice. I set that keg aside for a year to let it lager and when I tasted it, it had picked up an infection and it went sour and I had to dump it."
      
      - question: "What's your go-to commercial beer?"
        answer: "I am a huge fan of Cowtown's Vienna. I can't tell you how much money I've dropped on that particular beer. Now I wished I had invested when they started. =) When I have commercial beer at the house, the styles are all over the place. I like a variety."
      
      - question: "What's in your fermenter now?"
        answer: "Unfortunately, nothing. I started my own business a little over 5-years ago and it takes up a lot of time and has severely reduced my ability to brew. When I do brew, I will try to knock out two beers over a weekend. I have managed to cobble seven entries together for Bluebonnet this year."
      
      - question: "What's your favorite BJCP style to brew? To drink?"
        answer: "Oktoberfest for both. Every year as breweries produce their seasonal Oktoberfests I end up buying probably 8-10 different six-packs of Oktoberfest to see who's best. I usually hover toward Ayinger and Hacker-Pschorr. I am a big fan of German lagers and like to brew Helles, Vienna, Oktoberfest, and Doppelbocks."
      
      - question: "Tell us about your brewery. What does your set-up look like?"
        answer: "t's a two-tier HERMS set-up. I bought the burner stand at Academy a long time ago. I welded in a banjo burner on the boil kettle side to get up to temp faster. If I have time to pre-plan my brew day I will get all the water ready the night before and will use a heat stick in the hot liquor tank overnight to get it up to about 160F which saves some time in the morning. I have two different mash-tuns depending on what I am brewing, a 10-gallon for lower OG beers and a 15-gallon for big beers or if I am splitting a batch with a friend. I have been through a couple different mashtuns and am sold on Blichmann."
      
      - question: "Why do you homebrew?"
        answer: "I really like beer and the brewing process. I like having creative control over the process and trying to duplicate a good beer over again, which isn't always easy to do."
