With our Spirit of ‘76 All-American homebrew competition in full swing we thought we would take a moment to showcase an American beer style, talk about its origins, and how to brew a good example of one. Today we are going to take a dive into the Cream Ale BJCP Category 1C. 



So, what just what is this style all about? Well, the BJCP overall impression is noted as a clean, well-attenuated, highly carbonated, flavorful American “lawnmower” beer. Easily drinkable, smooth, and refreshing, with more character than typical American lagers, yet still subtle and restrained. The Cream Ale was originally designed to compete with the Ameran Lager style beers being produced in Canada and the US Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Midwest states. Basically, this beer is a quick fermenting, crushable, easy drinking beer to appeal to the masses.



So, what makes a good cream ale and how do you go about making one at home? Well first some stats. OG: 1.042 – 1.055 with an FG: 1.006 – 1.012. ABV should be in the 4.2 – 5.6% range. IBUs: 8 – 20 and SRM or color should be in the 2 – 5 range. Classic ingredients include American six-row malt, or a combination of six-row and North American two-row. I usually take the combo route. Up to 20% maize in the mash, and up to 20% sugar in the boil. I firmly believe in this step, and you absolutely need the sugar for that crisp, dry finish! Any variety of hops can be used, often rustic American or Continental. I personally prefer using Cluster or Liberty hops. Fermenting with clean ale yeast such as 1056 or simple US-05 works great. If you have never had a classic example grab you some Genesee Cream Ale! I’ve found it locally on taps around town and in cans at Total Wine.

Follow these guidelines and you can be well on your way to producing a clean, easy drinking summer crusher that just might win you a medal at the Spirt of 76!
