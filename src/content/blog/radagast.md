It’s a great time to \#flytheflag🏴‍☠️, y’all. At the AHA’s HomebrewCon in San Diego, your Horsemen were named the first club in Texas to ever win the award, which goes each year to a club that displays excellence in diversity, philanthropy, promotion of the homebrewing hobby, teaching, and “overall awesomeness.” It’s a big deal. Check out this write-up on the Beer in Big D blog all about the win for more info, and keep an eye out in Zymurgy magazine for an upcoming feature on the club!

To celebrate, our officers are working on some special merch. Stay tuned to our Facebook group for more info. The award also comes with a $1,000 prize to be split between the club and a charity of our choice. We’re currently taking nominations for nonprofits that the club should support, so email your suggestions to horsemenofthehops@gmail.com.

Hopefully you’ve already booked your ticket for the Spirit of ‘76 awards ceremony, which will be Saturday, July 8, at 1 p.m. at Corporate Employees Recreation Association, 3300 Bryant Irvin Road in Fort Worth. Tickets are $20 — paid members get in free — and include food, beer and some awesome raffle prizes. You can get a head start on the silent auction online here.

Finally, starting next month the Brew School column in this newsletter will look a little different. We’re starting a new advice column called Ask the Hoppy Horseman. Have a question about brewing technique, beer styles, ingredients or anything else homebrew? Email the Hoppy Horseman at horsemenofthehops@gmail.com and we’ll track down the answer for a future column! Think of it as “Dear Abby,” but with beer.

Cheers!🍻🐴🏴‍☠️
