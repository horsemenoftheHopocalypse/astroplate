After meeting Matt and being introduced to the world of homebrewing, she fell down the rabbit hole of judging and somehow decided that making her own mead was a good idea. Her mead has earned her a first place in the Texas Mead cup and several Bluebonnet medals. 

Known for organizing legendary events, she started as Director of Events for the Horsemen and quickly proved she knows how to throw one hell of a party. After serving as Vice President, she’s now stepping up as President; ready to tackle challenges, keep things running smoothly, and remind everyone that it’s not a competition… unless it’s being judged. All with a well-poured glass in hand.
