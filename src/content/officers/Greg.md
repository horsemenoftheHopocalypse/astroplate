It was a dark time for humanity. Hope was low. Morale was lower. Then Gregory made beer. One batch at a time, civilization stabilized, conversations improved, and the world narrowly avoided collapse. He's not saying his beer saved the world — but he's not not saying that either. Some call it brewing. Others call it heroic intervention. History will decide.

You’re welcome, Earth.

Still waiting on the statue.
