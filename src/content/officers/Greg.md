It was a dark time for humanity. Hope was low. Morale was lower. Then Gregory made beer. One batch at a time, civilization stabilized, conversations improved, and the world narrowly avoided collapse. He's not saying his beer saved the world — but he's not not saying that either. Some call it brewing. Others call it heroic intervention. History will decide.

You’re welcome, Earth.

Still waiting on the statue.

Gregory started brewing in ‘96 and was basically a “solo” brewer until becoming active with Horsemen. The instant camaraderie, openness to sharing ideas, and willing to accept brewers of all levels were all big draws for him.
