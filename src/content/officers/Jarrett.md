Forgemaster of Fermentation | Warlord of Wort

Award-winning homebrewer and Ninkasi champion, sworn to the ancient arts of hops, yeast, and controlled chaos. As a Certified BJCP Judge and Director of War & Competitions, I train brave soldiers one pint at a time—sharpening palates, strengthening livers, and preparing warriors to ride boldly into battle (or at least into the next flight of beers).

Known for helping rebuild the Horsemen, rallying the ranks, and turning grain into glory. My ales are strong, my critiques are fair, and my mead hall is always open. Drink well, judge honestly, and never face combat on an empty glass.
