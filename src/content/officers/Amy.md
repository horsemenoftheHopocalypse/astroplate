My love of beer started when it brought my husband and me together when we both volunteered at Rahr. With a lifelong passion for photography and a background in art and digital design, I’m proud to serve as our club historian. I document competitions, tastings, and events—preserving our shared memories and the evolution of our club. Cheers!🍻
